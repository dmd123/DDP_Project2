<h3>Course Project:</h3>
<h4>Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch</h4>
Submit this assignment before the deadline, June 19, 11:59 PM PDT<br>

<h5>This peer assessed assignment has two parts:</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.</li>
<li>Use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Part 1: Shiny Application</h5>
Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation.
<ul>
<li>Documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application</li>
<li>Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server</li>
<li>Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box</li>
<li>Share your server.R and ui.R code on github</li>
<li>The application must include the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)</li>
<li>Some operation on the ui input in sever.R<br>
<li>Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations</li>
<li>Enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application</li>
<li>Documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post an external link.</li>
<li>The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you</li>
</ul></Ul>

<h5>Part 2: Reproducible Pitch Presentation</h5>
Create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.
<ul>
<li>5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter</li>
<li>Push your presentation to github or Rpubs</li>
<li>A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box</li>
<li>Your presentation must satisfy the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter</li>
<li>5 pages</li>
<li>Hosted on github or Rpubs</li>
<li>Contain some embedded R code runs when slidifying the document</li>
<li>Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github or Rpubs, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line) http://slidify.org/publish.html</li>
<li>Rstudio presenter has a button to publish directly to Rpubs https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200714023-Displaying-and-Distributing-Presentations. If you are using Rpubs, put in the link to the presentation into the submission box as a http:// link not a https:// link.</li>
<li>You can also publish using both formats to github manually using gh-pages, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/ and there is a video lecture outlining how to do this.</li>
